Klapuri 2004 - 3.3.1 - Time-domain autocorrelation function (ACF) based algorithms are among the most frequently
used F0 estimators (see e.g. [Bro91, Tal95]). As pointed out by Tolonen and Karjalainen in
[Tol00], ACF-based F0 estimators have close model-level similarities with cepstrum-based F0
estimators [Nol67], and there is a continuum between them
